        <h2>Key Design Considerations:</h2>
        <p>When developing the system, we considered how we could design different aspects to best suit the needs of our customers.</p>
        <h3>Interaction with the robot</h3>
        <p>
            When the robot arrives at its destination to make a delivery, the recipient must scan their ID card on the RFID reader.
            Useful information is also displayed on the screen adjacent to it. We found that for ease of use and user comfort, the optimal angle
            would align with the avergae elbow height REF and be slanted at a 50 degree angle through some user testing within the team. From this,
            we positioned the screen and RFID reader at the top of the robot on a slanted front face at approimatly 50 degrees, which on the
            full sized robot would suit the average elbow height of 1020mm.
        </p>
        <h3>The User Interface</h3>
        <p>Big font, spacing, big buttons, simple and clear</p>
        <h3>Drawer Access</h3>
        <p>
            Biggest drawer located at the bottom of the robot for the larger, heavier items.
            After testing different drawer opening positions within the team, we established that we would want the drawers to open XXX to allow
            for items to be removed from and placed into the drawer easily.
