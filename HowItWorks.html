        <h2>Use Case:</h2>
        <h3>Ordering Equipment</h3>
        <p>The user will open the website and there they can see the available equiment and its location. They can then place an order,
        selecting the equipment they want and where they want it delivered to. If at that point there is no robot available to deliver
        the order, the user will be shown the nearest location for the equipment they need.</p>
        <p>Once the order has been placed, it will be assigned to a robot. The staff in the stores rooms will load the robot with the 
        orders before sending it on its way.</p>
        <p>Once localised, the robot will navigate to the delivery location via the quickest route and its display screen will change, 
        showing who the delivery is for.</p>
        <p>The user must then scan their ID card on the RFID reader on the front face of the robot which will unlock the draw(s) which
        contain their order. Once they have removed their order and shut the draw, the robot will then navigate either to make its next 
        delivery or back to the store room.</p>
        <h3>Sending Samples</h3>
        <p>The robot can also be requested to deliver samples, such as blood, to the labs. The system works in a similar way, whereby the
        user will place a request for the robot to go to a certain location where they can open the draw using their ID card to unlock
        it. They can then place the sample inside and the robot will then navigate to the specified lab to deliver the sample.</p>
        <h2>Human Factors:</h2>
        <p>When developing the system, we considered how we could design different aspects to best suit the needs of our customers.</p>
        <h3>Interaction with the robot</h3>
        <p>When the robot arrives at its destination to make a delivery, the recipient must scan their ID card on the RFID reader.
        Useful information is also displayed on the screen adjacent to it. We found that for ease of use and user comfort, the optimal angle
        would align with the avergae elbow height REF and be slanted at a XX degree angle through some user testing within the team. From this,
        we positioned the screen and RFID reader at the top of the robot on a slanted front face at approimatly XX degrees, which on the
        full sized robot would also it at the average elbow height of XXm tall.</p>
        <h3>The User Interface</h3>
        <p>Big font, spacing, big buttoms, simple and clear</p>
        <h3>Draw Access</h3>
        <p>Biggest draw at the bottom for the heavier items.
        After testing different draw opening positions within the team , we established that we would want the draws to open XXX to allow
        for items to be removed from and placed into the draw easily.</p>
