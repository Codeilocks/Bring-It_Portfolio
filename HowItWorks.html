    <h2>Use Case:</h2>
    <p>Stuff</p>
    <h2>Human Factors:</h2>
    <p>When developing the system, we considered how we could design different aspects to best suit the needs of our customers.</p>
    <h3>Interaction with the robot</h3>
    <p>When the robot arrives at its destination to make a delivery, the recipient must scan their ID card on the RFID reader.
    Useful information is also displayed on the screen adjacent to it. We found that for ease of use and user comfort, the optimal angle
    would align with the avergae elbow height REF and be slanted at a XX degree angle through some user testing within the team. From this,
    we positioned the screen and RFID reader at the top of the robot on a slanted front face at approimatly XX degrees, which on the
    full sized robot would also it at the average elbow height of XXm tall.</p>
    <h3>The User Interface</h3>
    <p>Big font, spacing, big buttoms, simple and clear</p>
    <h3>Draw Access</h3>
    <p>Biggest draw at the bottom for the heavier items.
    After testing different draw opening positions within the team , we established that we would want the draws to open XXX to allow
    for items to be removed from and placed into the draw easily.</p>
    <h2>Training Material:</h2>
    <p>Including, UI walk through, receiving and sending equipment/samples. Tech guide on replacing batteries and fault maintainence</p>
