        <h2>Use Case:</h2>
        <h3>Ordering Equipment</h3>
        <p>
            The user will open the website and there they can see the available equiment and its location. They can then place an order,
            selecting the equipment they want and where they want it delivered to. If at that point there is no robot available to deliver
            the order, the user will be shown the nearest location for the equipment they need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the order has been placed, it will be assigned to a robot. The staff in the stores rooms will load the robot with the
            orders before sending it on its way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once localised, the robot will navigate to the delivery location via the quickest route and its display screen will change,
            showing who the delivery is for.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user must then scan their ID card on the RFID reader on the front face of the robot which will unlock the drawer(s) which
            contain their order. Once they have removed their order and shut the drawer, the robot will then navigate either to make its next
            delivery or back to the store room.
        </p>
        <h3>Sending Samples</h3>
        <p>
            The robot can also be requested to deliver samples, such as blood, to the labs. The system works in a similar way, whereby the
            user will place a request for the robot to go to a certain location where they can open the drawer using their ID card to unlock
            it. They can then place the sample inside and the robot will then navigate to the specified lab to deliver the sample.
