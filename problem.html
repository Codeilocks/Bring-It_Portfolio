    <h2>The Problem:</h2>
    <p>A lot of time is spent by doctors and nurses on finding equipment. Doctors and nurses want to spend more time working directly with 
    patients. This isn't helped by the shortages of doctors and nurses. There is also the problem of retention of nurses due to the heavy 
    workload and being overworked. A third of healthcare workers (28%) admit to feeling overwhelmed at least once a week, with 17% feeling 
    burnt out every day[1]. Nurses on average walk 60,000 steps per week (26 miles) and this is a lot of walking.[2] Each month nurses 
    spend 40 hours looking for medical equipment. 16% of the survey participants stated that they have given up on their search as they 
    have failed to find the required medical equipment. [3]</p>
    <h2>Our Solution:</h2>
    <p>We aim for our solution to help with reducing the workload and increasing the efficiency around hospitals by taking away a menial 
    and tedious part of their job via an equipment delivery system allowing them to focus on the tasks that they were trained to do. This 
    would make the role more appealing, which directly contributes to NHS' first goal for 2023: Support NHS trusts to recruit nurses [4]. 
    We will have an embedded tracking system for the equipment for easy recovery of lost or misplaced equipment which increases the 
    efficiency of equipment finding.</p>
    <h2>Our Goals:</h2>
    <p>As a team, we decided to focus on the grad challenge of future health.</p>
