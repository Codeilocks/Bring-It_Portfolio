    <h2>The Problem:</h2>
    <p>
        A lot of time is spent by doctors and nurses on finding equipment. Doctors and nurses want to spend more time working directly with
        patients. This isn't helped by the shortages of doctors and nurses. There is also the problem of retention of nurses due to the heavy
        workload and being overworked. A third of healthcare workers (28%) admit to feeling overwhelmed at least once a week, with 17% feeling
        burnt out every day[1]. Nurses on average walk 60,000 steps per week (26 miles) and this is a lot of walking.[2] Each month nurses
        spend 40 hours looking for medical equipment. 16% of the survey participants stated that they have given up on their search as they
        have failed to find the required medical equipment. [3]

    <h2>Our Solution:</h2>
    <p>
        We aim for our solution to help with reducing the workload and increasing the efficiency around hospitals by taking away a menial
        and tedious part of their job via an equipment delivery system allowing them to focus on the tasks that they were trained to do. This
        would make the role more appealing, which directly contributes to NHS' first goal for 2023: Support NHS trusts to recruit nurses [4].
        We will have an embedded tracking system for the equipment for easy recovery of lost or misplaced equipment which increases the
        efficiency of equipment finding.

    <h2>Our Goals:</h2>
    <p>As a team, we decided to focus on the grand challenge of future health.</p>
