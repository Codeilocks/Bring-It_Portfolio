        <h2>Verification and Validation:</h2>
        <p>
            Talk about testing of different subsystems. How do we know it meets the requirements? 

            Throughout the development and build stages we have been keeping a
            <a href="https://github.com/lboroWMEME-TeamProject/B-ProjectDocs/blob/main/Project%20Management/Test%20Plan%20Document.xlsx">test plan</a>
            which details each of our tests and which requirements they verify.

        <h2>Limitations:</h2>
       <!-- <p>The robot will get stuck at doors. An assumption made here is that it can get through automatic doors and that they will only
        need to travel on a single floor (to avoid lifts and stairs) however we recognise doors would be an issue for the solution</p>
        <p>The robot has not been tested in a hospital environment which is much busier than our current, more controlled environment. 
        The system would also have to respond to emergencies, such as staff running through the corridors with patients on beds for example
        which would ristrict where it can be in the corridor so not to obstruct them.</p>
        <p>In our prototype, not all draws have full functionality. Only one draw currently has a locking mechanism and actuator in place</p>
        <p>The LiDAR has a smaller range than expected and so can not be used for mapping as intended which would be more effective than 
        just the kinect due to its 360 degree field of view</p>
        <p>The robot currently has to generate its own map of the building before it can be deployed there</p>
        <p>Kinect relies on visual odometry so performance is not guarenteed with plain environments</p>
        -->
        <p>The robot has been tested in a controlled environment. </p>                                                                                                                             
        <p>The robot must generate its own map of the environment before being used for intended purpose.</p>   
        <p>The robot relies on visual odometry to perform.</p>
        <p>The robot can navigate corridors with the assumption that doors would be automatic.</p>
        <p>One drawer is fully functional with scalability for other compartments available in the software.</p>
