        <h2>Our Team:</h2>
        <p>Within our team we have Jessica Webb, Karan Raheja, Mohamed Rabie, Rhiannon Edmonds, Sasmika Dharmalingam and Senay Oranus. 
        As a team we shared the admin and organisation work between us, taking it in turns to take meeting minutes for example.
        However, we each split our roles when it came to the development of each of the subsystems.</p>

        <p>Karan lead the development of the user interface and database aspect of the project which involved using a variety of programming skills</p>
        <p>The security and authentication was lead by Senay which involved programming and CAD design for the physical lock 
        along with the fault diagnosis subsystem </p>
        <p>Mohamed worked on machine vision using the Kinect camera integrated with the rest of the navigation work with Sasmika</p>
        <p>Jess and Rhiannon worked on the physical build of the robot. This included various CAD designs and making design decisions on how the overall system would work</p>
        <p>As a team we were also flexible with roles and so some of us also moved around and worked on other subsystems development, especially during integration</p>
