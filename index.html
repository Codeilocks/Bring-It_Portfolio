    <h2>Our Team:</h2>
    <p>Within our team we have Karan Raheja, Mohamed Rabie, Rhiannon Edmonds, Sasmika Dharmalingam, Senay Oranus and Jessica Webb</p>
    <p>As a team we shared the admin and organisation work between us, taking it in turns to take meeting minutes for example.</p>
    <p>However, we each split our roles when it came to the development of each of the subsystems.</p>
    <p>Karan lead the development of the user interface and database aspect of the project which involved using a variety of programming skills</p>
    <p>The security and authentication was lead by Senay which involved programming and CAD design for the physical lock</p>
    <p>Mohamed worked on machine vision using the Kinect camera integrated with the rest of the navigation work with Sasmika and Rhiannon</p>
    <p>Jess and Rhiannon worked on the physical build of the robot. This included various CAD designs and making design decisions on how the overall system would work</p>
